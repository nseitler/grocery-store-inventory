# grocery-store-inventory
 Unit 4 Project

In this project I will be building a console application that allows for easy interaction with inventory data. 

First need to read the data, clean it, and add it to a SQLite database. 

The database will have two tables, one for each CSV file. 

I will then create a console application using SQLAlchemyâ€™s ORM methods to give users the ability to view records, create records, edit and delete records, and display some analysis of the data. 

The users will also have the ability to create a backup of the data where two new CSV files are created reflecting the current state of the database.
